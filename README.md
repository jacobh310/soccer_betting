## Data Collection
In game statistics from the Premier league seasons 2000-2021 were collected from https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php. Each season has its own CSV file. The rows were mathces and the columns were game statitistcis. A row would contain the teams playing each other the respective stats for that game. 
#### Example
Home Team | Away Team | Home Shots | Away Shots| Home Goals| Away Goals| etc

A the british premier league has 20 teams and each team plays eachother twice. There would be a total of 380 matches each season which equals the amount of rows for each CSV file

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
As mentioned above, each row only contained what happened in that game. I created a preprocessing function that would take the rolling sum of each stats for each team and the divide by the matchweek to get the average. Then I removed the first 4 games of each season so the averae stats can stabilize. Each season was its own csv file so the above preocessing was done in a data frame for each season then appending together to make one large data set for seasons 2000-2021
